## Key Insights

### 1. The Winning Parlay (IMG_0206) Was NOT AI-Recommended
Your only winning parlay appears to be your own picks, not AI recommendations.

### 2. AI-Matched Bets: 0% Parlay Win Rate
| Source | Parlays | Wins | Leg Hit Rate |
|--------|---------|------|--------------|
| AI-Matched | 4 | 0 | 43.75% (7/16) |
| User Picks | 8 | 1 | 55.0% (22/40) |

### 3. Recurring Problem: SGA Over 31.5 pts
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Over 31.5 pts appears in 3 parlays - **all 3 missed** (actual: 26 pts).

### 4. The Herbert Disaster
AI projected Herbert at 295 yards. He threw for 151. The entire game thesis (high-scoring, pass-heavy) was wrong.

### 5. Close Losses
- Booker: Needed 25.5, got 24 (missed by 1.5)
- Murray: Needed 4.5 assists, got 4 (missed by 0.5)
- Several parlays missed by just 1 leg

## Recommendations

### For AI Improvements
1. **Don't trust game script predictions** - Herbert disaster shows AI can't predict defensive dominance
2. **Be more conservative on projections** - AI was systematically optimistic
3. **Add injury/matchup verification** - Multiple DNPs hurt

### For Betting Strategy
1. **Lower leg count** - 4-leg parlays at 51% leg rate = ~6.8% parlay win rate. Math checks out.
2. **Avoid stacking overs** - Correlated losses when game goes low-scoring
3. **The winning parlay was conservative** - Goblin tier picks, lower lines
